CaveGame
========

> The very typical cave/chopper game, ported to iOS using iPad's Codea app

This little game emulates the usual Chopper game. It uses one of the default Codea's sprites, fixes its x coordinate and moves it around the y axis, also rotating it to simulate the motion of a rocket.

The cave is rendered as many small rectangles, although at the moment there is no collision detection, it wouldn't be too hard to implement.

See a little demo of the program in action:
