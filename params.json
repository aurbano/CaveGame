It uses one of the default Codea's sprites, fixes its x coordinate and moves it around the y axis, also rotating it to simulate the motion of a rocket.\r\n\r\nThe cave is rendered as many small rectangles, although at the moment there is no collision detection, it wouldn't be too hard to implement.\r\n\r\n###LUA Source\r\nThere are two classes:\r\n* [Main](https://github.com/aurbano/CaveGame/blob/master/CaveiOSgame.codea/Main.lua)\r\n* [Cave](https://github.com/aurbano/CaveGame/blob/master/CaveiOSgame.codea/Cave.lua)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Meta\r\n\r\nDevelped by [Alejandro U.
